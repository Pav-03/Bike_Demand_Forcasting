# Bike_Demand_Forcasting

## Problem Statement

A client is exploring the feasibility of expanding their business into short-term rental cycles in London. To support their decision-making, they require insights into existing cycling usage patterns to understand demand, customer behavior, and operational challenges. Specifically, they are interested in:

1.   Customer segmentation
2.   Expected usage trends
3.   Operational concerns such as reliability and supply chain management

By analyzing Transport for London (TFL) cycling data (2021-2023), I aim to derive actionable insights that will help the client design an effective strategy for their expansion.
